	   <a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/oral-history-of-mamma-mia"> <p>When Meryl Streep arrived in Tokyo for the Japanese premiere of Mamma Mia!, she was alerted that there may be a surprise guest in the audience. Empress Michiko, the first commoner to marry into the Japanese Imperial family, is revered across that country for her peerless grace and elegance. She is also, apparently, a pretty big Mamma Mia! fan; the stage musical premiered in Japan in 2002, becoming the same sensation with audiences there that it had everywhere else. With a film adaptation starring Streep about to hit theaters, the empress, then 74, expressed interest in attending the premiere as a guest of honor.<br> <br> “We weren’t allowed to know if she was gonna be there,” Streep recently told Vogue. “But if she did come, we were all instructed not to talk or look at her as a sign of respect.” <br> <br>Yet when Streep turned up to Roppongi Hills for the premiere, not only was the empress in attendance, but she was seated right next to Streep for the screening, with her personal security detail—a group of 80-ish men in matching suits and ties—surrounding them. Even the greatest actor of all time couldn’t hide her discomfort when the lights went down and the film began: Streep fidgeted in her seat throughout the opening number, in which her onscreen daughter parses the details of her mother’s raucous sex life. </p> </a>

Known for luminous plays (The Aliens, Circle Mirror Transformation, The Flick, John) in which the everyday is shot through with a glowing, almost uncanny edge, her searching new play, Infinite Life, opens at the Atlantic Theater Company on September 12 in a co-production with the National Theatre in London.</p></a>

      <a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/alicia-keys-hells-kitchen-november-2023" class="text-dark"><p class="card-text">An empty arena is an eerie place. I feel this distinctly on a Tuesday in early August as I hasten across an enormous parking lot to the dark entrance of the Oakland Arena, a 19,200-seat venue just east of the San Francisco Bay. Near the checkpoint where I wait, a metal detector blinks and beeps indiscriminately.</p></a>
